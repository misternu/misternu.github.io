<!-- Comments Section
##How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
  It was pretty easy, partly because we already had strong agreement about what it should look like.
##Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
  I'm sure that it will be more useful later when we are able to use css, right now since we are only writing semantic html it felt like an unnecessary step.
##What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
  We spoke about where the user's eyes would end up first when reading the page, and based the design on making their experience as comfortable as possible given how we imagined that they would use the site.
##What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any) ?
  We talked about section article and nav, but we only ended up using divs in the template.
