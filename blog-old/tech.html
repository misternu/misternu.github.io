    <h1>Test Driven Development</h1>
    <h4>November 22, 2015</h4>
    <p>
      I had been lead to believe, by the curriculum that we followed and other experiences, that test driven development happened like this: Write a bunch of tests defining everything your program does first, and then write the code to pass them one at a time. Then refactor a little bit at a time, always running the tests again.
    </p>
    <p>
      As it turns out, there is a lot of disagreement out there about not only how to do test driven development, but what it means. I read about a lot of these opinions in a summary linked at the bottom of this post. I want to focus on what I think the biggest difference is.
    </p>
    <p>
      I get the impression that you're actually only supposed to write one test, or the tests for one feature, before then writing the code for that feature and refactoring. In this way you bounce back and forth between the testing and the actual code, and the program slowly evolves to meet demands instead of being created as a planned monolith. This is both great and troubling.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think it's great because it allows you to just focus on one problem at a time. I think it is troubling because it sounds like a recipe for technical debt. It sounds like just having an easy time now so you can have a harder and harder time later. In biological evolution this kind of adaptation process has proven to be very powerful. But given that we have the advantage of being able to design our whole systems, why would we give it up for convenience?
