# Personal Website Redesign

## Overview

Redesigning timothymeixell.com (points to this github page) to reflect current
experience and interests. Original site was bootcamp-era (2015), nature-themed
with Arizona mountain vista background.

## Technical Decisions

### Static Site Generator

- **Keep Jekyll** - already set up in repo, build and push to deploy
- Maintain markdown functionality for content management
- Remove blog/portfolio links from navigation (keep files in repo, just don't display)

### Styling

- **Plain CSS** - direct control for custom 80s aesthetic
- No Tailwind needed for this use case

## Content Strategy

### Main Page Structure

- Profile/intro section
- **Two featured portfolio items** (highlighted projects)
- Social links (GitHub, Twitter, LinkedIn)
- Contact/availability info

### Professional Positioning

- **Highlight Python prominently** - job market priority
- Rails/Ruby experience - nearly a decade
- Full-stack web developer
- Human-readable description, not keyword dump
- Reflect current experience level (drop "recently graduated" bootcamp references)

### Portfolio Approach

- Two major items on main page (short term)
- If collection grows, add separate portfolio page later
- Always keep two "highlighted" projects on homepage

## Design Direction

### Aesthetic

- **80s nostalgia vibe** with nature elements
- Synthwave-inspired (neon colors, retro styling)
- Incorporate nature imagery (maintain Arizona mountain theme?)
- Consider: neon colors over mountain silhouettes, retro geometric shapes

### What to Remove/Hide

- Blog section links (keep files)
- Portfolio.html links (keep files)
- Dev Bootcamp references
- Echo project (outdated)
- "Recently graduated" language

## Current State

- Single-page site
- Background image: Arizona mountain vista (copyright 2015)
- Profile image
- Social links: GitHub, Twitter, LinkedIn
- Minimal content

## Next Steps

1. Design 80s + nature aesthetic (color palette, typography, layout)
2. Write updated professional description
3. Define two featured portfolio items
